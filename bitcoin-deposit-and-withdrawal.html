		<h3>
			Bitcoin Deposit
		</h3>
		Before you can make a Bitcoin (BTC) deposit to your NiceHash wallet you must first have the desired amount of BTC in your own Bitcoin wallet. You can exchange FIAT money for Bitcoin through exchanges that support FIAT to crypto conversion. You can deposit different cryptocurrencies to your NiceHash account so make sure you are depositing the correct cryptocurrency. Depositing the incorrect cryptocurrency to a specific address might result in the irreversible loss of funds!

	Take these steps to deposit Bitcoin to your NiceHash wallet:

	<ol>
		<li>Log in to your NiceHash account.</li>
		<li>Click the Wallet tab.</li>
		<li>Click the Deposit button.</li>
		<li>Click the ‚ÄúSHOW (BTC) ADDRESS‚Äù button.</li>
		<li>In this step, you have to open your own Bitcoin wallet. This might be your exchange account, your hardware wallet or your mobile wallet. Every Bitcoin wallet has a different interface but you should find a SEND or WITHDRAWAL button. Our example here is taken using Coinbase.</li>
		<li>Copy and paste your deposit address from NiceHash to your Bitcoin wallet or scan the QR code with your smartphone if you are using a mobile wallet or app.</li>
		<li>Confirm the transaction within your Bitcoin wallet. Once the Bitcoin miners and the network have confirmed the transaction you will see your deposited funds in your NiceHash wallet.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>
		Bitcoin Withdrawal
	</h3>
		Withdrawal is the process of moving the funds from your NiceHash wallet to some external wallet address. This can be your hard wallet address, exchange address, mobile wallet address etc. Withdrawals are subject to fees.

Please follow these steps to successfully withdraw Bitcoin from your wallet:
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your Wallet and click the Withdraw button.</li>
<li>Select Bitcoin wallet in the ‚ÄúWithdraw from‚Äù field.</li>
<li>Select withdrawal address or add a new withdrawal address. PLEASE NOTE: Withdrawing to the incorrect address might result in the irreversible loss of funds!</li>
<li>Enter the amount of Bitcoin you wish to withdraw.</li>
<li>Click Review withdraw button.</li>
		<li>A confirmation screen will pop up. Click Withdraw to complete the withdrawal process. PLEASE NOTE: Withdrawing to the incorrect address might result in the irreversible loss of funds!</li>
</ol>
